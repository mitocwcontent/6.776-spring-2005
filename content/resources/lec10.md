description: 'Lecture presentation covering the following topics: noise modeling in
  amplifiers including notation for mean, variance, and correlation, relationship
  between variance and spectral density, the impact of filtering on spectral density,
  noise in resistors, inductors and capacitors, CMOS transistors, drain noise, induced
  gate noise, noise sources, remove model components for simplicity, key noise sources
  for noise analysis, Thevenin techniques, drain noise multiplying factor, broadband
  amplifier design considerations, narrowband amplifier noise requirements, and achieving
  minimum noise factor.'
